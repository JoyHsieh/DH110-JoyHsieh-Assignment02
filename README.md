# Assignment 02: Usability Testing - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Purpose of Usability Testing
This pilot usability test was conducted to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the [TimeSlips](http://timeslips.org) website, a potential competitor of my final project.  TimeSlips is website that allows seniors to write and share creative stories.  
From the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/JoyHsieh/DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment01) that I previously conducted, I wanted to test the following usability issues:
* consistency and standards
* error prevention
* recognition rather than recall  

This usability test was conducted with a pilot tester that had never used the website before to give insight on how it could be improved from the user's perspective.
## Process & Materials
This test was conducted using Zoom. The participant filled out this [Google Form survey](https://forms.gle/pEV1z25oqj9KdQSY8) on a computer and had their reactions recorded. The survey consisted of:
* introduction
* informed consent
* background questions
* pre-test questions
* 3 usability tasks
* post-test questions
* product satisfaction questions
* demographic information

This was a pilot test that was conducted in order to test the setting and materials for future testing.

## Summary of Findings & Reflection
### What I learned
This test taught me how valuable it is to have a novel user take a look at the website because they can validate your findings and uncover even more issues. The participant also had difficulty identifying where to perform certain tasks, like write a story. Overall, the strong aesthetics of the website led the participant to have a postive view of the website, calling it "fresh", "familiar", "trustworthy", and "professional". However, the difficulty in performing some tasks was enough for the participant to also call the site "intimidating". Though he generally found the website easy to use, he recognized that it was unnecessarily complex. This will likely come into play more for the seniors, when complexity could be a deal breaker in usability. From a technical point of view, I learned how to set up a comprehensive usability testing survey and how to upload a video to YouTube.
### What went well
I felt comfortable as the moderator since I have experience as a research assistant in a lab on campus. I also had no issues setting up the Zoom, downloading the video, or uploading it to YouTube. The participant was able to successfully complete some tasks, but not all which I think meant the tasks were well balanced. The participant caught on to some of the usability issues that I noticed but also uncovered some new ones.
### What didn't go so well
I forgot to add a link to the website and had the same question on my survey twice. The Zoom recording made the participant's face look a lot smaller than in the actual call, so it was hard to look at and analyze his reactions from the video after the fact. There were also some typos that made reading the prompts a bit clunky.
### How I want to improve
Next time, I will:
* review the survey or other testing materials more thoroughly to make sure that there are no errors
* practice reading the prompts to make the experience smoother for the participants
* take more notes during the test so I can remember my observations about the user's observations
* calibrate the tasks to better fit the usability issues
