# Assignment 02: Usability Testing - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Purpose of Usability Testing
This pilot usability test was conducted to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the [TimeSlips](http://timeslips.org) website, a potential competitor of my final project.  TimeSlips is website that allows seniors to write and share creative stories.  
From the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/JoyHsieh/DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment01) that I previously conducted, I wanted to test the following usability issues:
* consistency and standards
* error prevention
* recognition rather than recall  

This usability test was conducted with a pilot tester that had never used the website before to give insight on how it could be improved from the user's perspective.
## Process & Materials
This test was conducted using Zoom. The participant filled out this [Google Form survey](https://forms.gle/pEV1z25oqj9KdQSY8) on a computer and had their reactions recorded. The survey consisted of:
* background questions
* pre-test questions
* 3 usability tasks
* post-test questions
* product satisfaction questions
* demographic information

This was a pilot test that was conducted in order to test the setting and materials for future testing.
